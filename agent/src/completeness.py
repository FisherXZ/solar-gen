"""Completeness evaluation for EPC research (Harvey AI pattern).

At checkpoint iterations (6, 12, 18), evaluates what the agent has done
so far and produces a message to inject into the conversation. Uses
deterministic heuristics on tool call patterns — no extra LLM call needed.

Three escalation levels:
- Iteration 6:  Gentle — "have you completed Phase 2?"
- Iteration 12: Firm   — "diminishing returns, you SHOULD wrap up"
- Iteration 18: Mandatory — "you MUST call report_findings now"

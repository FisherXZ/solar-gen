You are synthesizing EPC research findings for a solar project into a structured report.

## Project
{project_summary}

## Evidence Collected ({n_findings} findings from {n_searches} searches)
{evidence}

## Searches Performed
{searches}

## Instructions
Based on the evidence above, produce a structured assessment of the EPC contractor \
for this project. Be honest: if evidence is insufficient, report confidence="unknown" \
rather than guessing.

For the reasoning field, use this structure:
- summary: 1-2 sentences stating your conclusion. Cite sources as [1], [2] etc.
- supporting_evidence: Key evidence points, strongest first
- gaps: What's missing or uncertain

For sources, only include sources that DIRECTLY support your EPC determination. \
Each source must have a real URL from the evidence, a channel classification, \
and a reliability rating.

For confidence:
- confirmed: 2+ independent sources, at least one first-party
- likely: 1 reliable source specifically naming EPC for THIS project
- possible: Indirect evidence only
- unknown: No project-specific EPC evidence after thorough search

An honest "unknown" after thorough research is better than an unverified guess.
